Hi, Iâ€™m Matt Fortuna. I work as a Full Stack Developer at Adaptly in New York. Beforehand, I worked at Talking Points Memo as a Full Stack Developer and Common Living as a Full Stack Intern. Before that, I studied Physics and Computer Science and did research in Solar Technology at Tulane University.

In my free time I run, read, play basketball and guitar, draw, take photos, and hike.
