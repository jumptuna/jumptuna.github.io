I'm a Software Engineer based in NYC working for Adaptly - Accenture. 

This site is currently under construction, but will soon be home to my coding blog and art.

Thanks to <a href="https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/">Dean Attali</a> for making starting this site easy with his open source theme.
