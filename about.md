title: About me

Hey, Iâ€™m Matt. I'm a Software Engineer based in NYC working for Adaptly - Accenture. I previously worked at Talking Points Memo as a Full Stack Developer and Common Living as a Full Stack Intern. I also studied Physics and Computer Science and did research in Solar Technology at Tulane University.

Outside of coding I run, read, play basketball and guitar, draw/paint, take photos, and hike.

This site is currently under construction, but will soon be home to my coding blog and art.

Thanks to <a href="https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/">Dean Attali</a> for making starting this site easy with his open source theme.
